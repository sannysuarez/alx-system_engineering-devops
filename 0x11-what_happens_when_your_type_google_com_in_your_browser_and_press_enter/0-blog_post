Demystifying the Journey: What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com and Press Enter

Have you ever wondered what really happens behind the scenes when you type a URL into your browser and hit Enter? The seemingly simple act initiates a complex series of steps that involve various components of the web stack. In this blog post, we'll unravel the journey from typing "https://www.google.com" to seeing the Google homepage, exploring each crucial step in the process.
1.	DNS Request:
The journey begins with a Domain Name System (DNS) request. When you type "https://www.google.com" and press Enter, your browser needs to translate the human-readable domain name (www.google.com) into an IP address that machines can understand. This is achieved through a DNS resolution process, involving recursive and authoritative DNS servers. Once resolved, the IP address is cached locally to expedite future requests.
2.	TCP/IP:
With the IP address obtained, the next step involves establishing a connection through the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). TCP ensures reliable communication by breaking down data into packets, sequencing them, and confirming their receipt. IP, on the other hand, handles the routing of these packets across the internet.
3.	Firewall:
As the data packets traverse the internet, they encounter firewalls â€“ security measures implemented to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic. Firewalls protect against unauthorized access and potential threats, ensuring the safety and security of the network.
4.	HTTPS/SSL:
In our era of heightened cyber security concerns, ensuring a secure connection is paramount. This is where HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) come into play. HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between the browser and the server, safeguarding it from potential eavesdropping or tampering. SSL certificates authenticate the identity of the website, establishing trust between the user and the server.
5.	Load-Balancer:
Large-scale websites like Google often employ load balancers to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers. This ensures optimal resource utilization, prevents server overload, and enhances the website's scalability and availability. Load balancers play a crucial role in improving response times and minimizing downtime.
6.	Web Server:
After passing through the load balancer, the request reaches the web server. The web server's responsibility is to handle HTTP requests, process them, and generate an appropriate response. In Google's case, the web server might retrieve the requested web page and associated assets from its cache or interact with other components to generate dynamic content.
7.	Application Server:
For dynamic websites, an application server comes into play. It executes server-side logic, processes requests, interacts with databases, and generates dynamic content. In Google's case, the application server may handle user authentication, personalize content, and perform various backend tasks to deliver a tailored experience.
8.	Database:
The final piece of the puzzle is the database. The application server interacts with the database to retrieve and store data. In the context of a search engine like Google, this step involves querying vast amounts of indexed information to provide relevant search results.

The journey from typing "https://www.google.com" to seeing the Google homepage is a complex orchestration of DNS requests, TCP/IP communication, firewall protection, secure HTTPS connections, load balancing, web server processing, application server logic, and database interactions. Understanding these intricacies provides valuable insight into the functioning of the web stack and is crucial for anyone navigating the world of software engineering. The next time you press Enter, appreciate the intricate dance of technology working seamlessly to deliver the web content you seek.
